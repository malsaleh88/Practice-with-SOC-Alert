## **Investigation Findings**
- The attack **was a real SQL Injection attempt** using `OR 1=1`, which is commonly used for authentication bypass.
- **No unauthorized login or database modification was detected**.
- The **last successful login was on February 10, 2022**, which is before the attack on February 25, 2022.
- **The attack was NOT successful.**
- The attacker's IP has been **blocked** and **reported to DigitalOcean**.
- Web security measures such as **input validation, prepared statements, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) enhancements** are being reviewed to prevent future attacks.

---

## **Conclusion**
âœ… **Alert Classification:** **True Positive** (The attack was real but unsuccessful)  
ðŸš€ **Recommended Actions:**
- **Block attackerâ€™s IP (`167.99.169.17`)** in the firewall.
- **Review SQL query logs** to ensure no unauthorized access occurred.
- **Enhance security** by implementing **prepared statements** and **WAF rules**.
- **Report abuse** to DigitalOcean via [DigitalOcean Abuse Report](https://www.digitalocean.com/company/contact/#abuse).



I checked the log management system to verify if the attack was successful. Based on the logs, the HTTP response status codes provide critical insights.

## Observations
- Normal requests returned **HTTP 200**, indicating successful responses.
- Suspicious queries resulted in **HTTP 500**, which suggests a possible server error.
- Normally, if the attack were successful, we should have seen a **response containing usernames and passwords**.

## Conclusion
Since the response code was **500**, the attack does not appear to have been successful. Instead of retrieving sensitive information, the server encountered an error, possibly due to improper input handling.
