### **Step 2: Collect Information**
- **Ownership of Source IP:** Tencent Cloud (AS45090, China)  
- **Reputation Check:** IP scored **-15** in VirusTotal (community flagged suspicious).  
- **Target System:** Windows Server 2019 (not Linux, making the attack ineffective).

### **Step 3: Identify the Type of Attack**
- **Attack Type:** Local File Inclusion (LFI)  
- **Reason:** The attacker attempted to exploit a web vulnerability to read system files using path traversal.

### **Step 4: Is the Traffic Malicious?**
- ‚úÖ **Yes, the traffic is malicious.**
- Even though the attacker targeted a Linux file on a Windows server, this was a **clear attack attempt**.

### ‚úÖ **Final Recommendations**
1. **Monitor for repeated attacks** from IP `106.55.45.162`.
2. **Block the attacker's IP** if further suspicious activity is detected.
3. **Implement security measures** (e.g., WAF rules) to prevent LFI attacks.
4. **Ensure proper input validation** on web applications to mitigate LFI risks.

üöÄ **This completes the investigation.**
